# OpenH2
OpenH2 is a personal project of reverse engineering the Halo 2 (Vista) map file format. I am explicitly avoiding any reverse engineering of binaries or distributed tooling. 

# General architecture
A map file is deserialized into a version-specific set of types. This map file is then translated to common format types for use in the engine by the Scenario Abstraction Layer (SAL). 

![Architecture diagram](doc/Assets/architecture.png)

Map deserialization is currently defined via attributes on the Tag types and a deserializer type is generated by emitting the code to parse the binary map data as IL into a set of dynamic methods.

# Tools

## Scenario Explorer
The Scenario Explorer is the main tool used for reverse engineering the tag formats. It contains an integrated hex viewer with best-effort auto-detection of tag sections and references. In "Discovery mode" the tag tree is built based on auto-detection of tag references. In "Exploration mode" the tree is built via the static tag references in the types. The tool is built with AvaloniaUI.

## Miscellaneous tooling
There are a number of dumping and analysis tools also in the solution, but they're not intended for long term use and will eventually be removed. 

# Progress History

## November 2019
All static geometry and crate objects loading, with textures (although shaders with multiple textures aren't quite right). Animated meshes are incorrect, such as the Zanzibar house gate.
